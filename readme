                                                        -----------------------------------------
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing real-world sales data from Zepto, a quick-commerce platform. The objective of this project is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), aggregation, and visualization using Python.

The dataset contains over 200,000 sales transaction records along with a product catalog. Through this project, I implemented a complete data analysis workflow — from raw data processing to generating meaningful business insights.

📂 Dataset Description

The project uses two datasets:

1️⃣ zepto_sales.csv
Contains transactional sales data with the following columns:

order_id – Unique order identifier

order_date – Date and time of order

product_id – Product identifier

quantity – Units sold

city – City of order

delivery_status – Delivery status (Delivered, Cancelled, Returned)

customer_id – Customer identifier

delivery_time_mins – Delivery time in minutes

total_amount – Total transaction amount

2️⃣ zepto_products.csv

Contains product catalog information:

product_id – Unique product identifier

product_name – Name of product

category – Product category

base_price – Base price of product

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🔎 Project Workflow
✅ Step 1: Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded both datasets using Pandas

Checked shape, data types, summary statistics

Examined missing values and duplicates

✅ Step 2: Data Cleaning

Removed rows with missing values in city and delivery_status

Filled missing values in delivery_time_mins using mean

Removed duplicate records

Converted order_date into datetime format

✅ Step 3: Data Analysis

Performed aggregation and grouping operations to extract insights such as:

Minimum, maximum, and average transaction amount

Top 5 products by total sales

Total sales by city

Average delivery time by city

Monthly sales trend

Sales by product category

✅ Step 4: Data Visualization

Created meaningful visualizations including:

Bar charts (Top products, Sales by city)

Line chart (Monthly sales trend)

Pie chart (Sales by category)

Histogram (Delivery time distribution)

📊 Key Insights

Identified the highest revenue-generating products

Determined top-performing cities based on sales

Analyzed delivery performance across cities

Observed monthly sales trends


Evaluated contribution of each product category to total revenue
